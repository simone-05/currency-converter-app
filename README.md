A minimal currency converter app. Offline, simple and fast.

## What is it?
It is a very lightweight android app designed for quick, offline currency conversion.
Ideal for travelers and anyone needing a fast, reliable conversion tool without any extra features.
It just does what is supposed to do nothing else.

## Usage
| Main Screen | Conversion Screen |
|:---:|:---:|
| The first screen is used to input the name of the currencies and the conversion ratio (pay attention to the direction of the conversion) | The second screen will have the amount input with the automatic display of the corresponding amount in the other currency |

It will automatically save the inputs, so that if you close the application it will resume right from the conversion screen, for fastest usage.
